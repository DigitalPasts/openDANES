## An interdisciplinary workspace for digital humanities historical research

The Digital Pasts Lab (DigPasts-Lab) is geared towards performing innovative, quality research in digital humanities, with an emphasis on historical research. We aim to create an interdisciplinary workspace among different humanities researchers and between humanities researchers and data scientists, which develops and enriches both worlds, while developing state-of-the-art technologies for historical research.

Heading the lab is Dr Shai Gordin, senior lecturer in assyriology and digital humanities. His particular interests are machine identification and translation of cuneiform signs, human and machine cooperation, spatial data analysis, social networks, and linked open data.
