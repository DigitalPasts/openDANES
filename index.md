Welcome to OpenDANES, the official portal of the Digital Ancient Near Eastern Studies Network. Our mission is to promote the integration of computational approaches with traditional historical, archaeological and philological methods. The network also focuses on the critical use of digital text analysis and visual analysis of ancient Near Eastern objects.

The Digital Ancient Near Eastern Studies (DANES) network is a consortium of scholars who study the ancient Near East and scholars from computer and data science. Our purpose is to teach, learn, and share best practices of using computational methods and tools to rediscover our past. The network has an annual conference and working groups. It was initiated in 2023 with our {% include link.html url="https://digitalpasts.github.io/DANES/" content="opening conference" %}.
