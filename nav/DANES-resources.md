The following page includes a list of digital, free to use, online resources for studying the ancient Near East. It is divided into six main categories.

- **Databases**: datasets that are explorable through online interfaces and some are downloadable
- **Datasets**: which are downloadable for further study, but without online interfaces
- **Tools**: online applications which aid study and research, and require no background in programming
- **Programming Resources**: primarily code repositories for computationally studying the ancient Near East
- **Academic Resources**: online repositories of free articles, books, and other high-quality academic content
- **Dictionaries and Abbreviations**: pedagogical resources for studying the ancient Near East at the modern age
