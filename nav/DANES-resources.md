The following page includes a list of digital, free to use, online resources for studying the ancient Near East. It is divided into six main categories.

- **Databases**: datasets that are explorable through online interfaces and some are downloadable
- **Datasets**: which are downloadable for further study, but without online interfaces
- **Tools**: online applications which aid study and research, and require no background in programming
- **Programming Resources**: primarily code repositories for computationally studying the ancient Near East
- **Academic Resources**: online repositories of free articles, books, and other high-quality academic content
- **Dictionaries and Abbreviations**: pedagogical resources for studying the ancient Near East at the modern age

The resources can be related to one or more of the following fields, and they are marked as such by identifying symbols:
