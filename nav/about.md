Welcome to OpenDANES, the official portal of the Digital Ancient Near Eastern Studies (DANES) network. We are a peer-reviewed academic venue that publishes high-quality tutorials and research papers employing the cutting edge computational approaches to ancient Near Eastern texts, art, and artefacts.

In recent years, the field of Near Eastern studies has undergone a digital revolution, with comprehensive online repositories making the digital publishing of ancient artefacts, texts, and art a more sustainable and common practice **(LINK)**. Moreover, the application of computational methods, from quantitative and statistical analyses to more advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) models, has opened up new possibilities for answering novel and complex questions about ancient civilizations.

At OpenDANES, we are committed to promoting scholarship and advancing pedagogical tools and code. We welcome novice and advance level tutorials, original research articles, project reviews, and resources that address a wide range of topics related to the intersection of computational approaches and the study of the Ancient Near East. Our peer-review process is rigorous and transparent, ensuring the highest quality standards for the papers we publish.

Thank you for visiting OpenDANES. We look forward to receiving your submissions and continuing to build a vibrant community of scholars and students in this exciting and rapidly evolving field.

## Editorial Board
