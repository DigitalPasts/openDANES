## DANES 2023
### Material Culture fornt he Middle Babylonain Period (McMiB)
Dr. Sara Arroyo Cuadra, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (UNED).

This poster aims to show the main objectives to be developed within the project "Material culture from Middle Babylonian period (McMiB): digitalization and democratization of the access to the cultural heritage of the Ancient Near East", funded thanks to a "María Zambrano" Postdoctoral Fellowship.

To this end, the project proposes the creation of the open access website "Material culture from Middle Babylonian Period (McMiB)", which will house a digital collection of archaeological pieces from the Middle Babylonian period (1500-1100 BC). The main innovation of this collection is that it will consist exclusively of pieces containing both iconographic motifs and inscriptions, so that for each of them images (whenever possible in 3D), drawings, text translation and transdisciplinary analysis will be provided. Given the traditional separation of disciplines in this field of knowledge, this project will bring together for the first time Near Eastern Archaeology, History and Art History with Assyriology and the Digital Humanities, with the aim of achieving a holistic understanding of Middle Babylonian culture. At the same time, the transfer of this knowledge will be facilitated through open access to the Web, giving back to society the right to access both the public heritage created by past cultures and the research generated around it within public institutions.

This project will therefore involve the creation of a relational yet individualized database of Babylonian kudurru, Middle Babylonian cylinder-seals, and Middle Babylonian inscribed statues and figurines. This database will include all the information collected during the first phase of the project: numerous photographs of the pieces taken in their respective museums (with the aim of creating a virtual 3D reconstruction of as many pieces as possible through photogrammetry), drawings of the pieces, compilation of the information about each piece on the websites of the museums and other websites such as ORACC, CDLI, etc. (including the transliteration and translation of the respective inscriptions), and inclusion of the publications in which each piece is mentioned.  At the same time, a detailed transdisciplinary analysis of the pieces will be provided, highlighting both the similarities and the discrepancies between the information provided by the iconographic motifs and that derived from the inscriptions.
Finally, the information integrated in this database will be uploaded to an open access website where all this information will be available for consultation, including a specific search for related data, a "virtual visit" to the 3D digitized pieces and links to projects, websites and bibliography where information about them can be found.
